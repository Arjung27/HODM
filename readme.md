## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the Human Obstacle Detection module. The human obstacle detector module can take the image/video as input and output the localization of the detected humans in the robotâ€™s reference frame. The output of the module contains the bottom left corner, the top right corner and the center of the bounding box (that contains the human), and a confidence value of detection. This module can be further integrated with a task-specific control module (such as path planning module) which utilizes the detection information.
